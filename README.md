# SORTING ALGORITHM VISUALIZER
Sorting Visualizer: A Python project with a graphical interface using tkinter to demonstrate Insertion, Selection, and Bubble Sort algorithms step-by-step on an array. Adjustable speed control for better visualization.


Project Description: Sorting Visualizer in Python

In this project, we will create a Sorting Visualizer using Python and three popular sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort. The Sorting Visualizer will provide a graphical representation of how these sorting algorithms work step-by-step, making it easier to understand their sorting process.

Key Features:
1. Graphical Interface: We will create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a Python library like Tkinter or Pygame. The GUI will display an array of bars representing the elements to be sorted.

2. Random Array Generation: The Sorting Visualizer will allow users to generate a random array of integers. This array will serve as the input data for sorting.

3. Visualization: The main focus of this project is to visually demonstrate how the sorting algorithms work. As the algorithms sort the array, the GUI will update the bars' positions to reflect the current state of the array after each step.

4. Step-by-Step Execution: The Sorting Visualizer will execute the sorting algorithms step-by-step, allowing users to observe each algorithm's behavior closely.

5. Sorting Algorithm Options: Users will be able to choose which sorting algorithm they want to visualize: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, or Bubble Sort.

6. Adjustable Speed: The visualizer will have an adjustable speed control so that users can slow down or speed up the sorting process for better observation.

7. Color Indications: The bars representing the array elements will have different colors to indicate their current status (e.g., unsorted, being compared, swapped).

Implementation Steps:

1. Set up the graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or Pygame, depending on your preference and experience.

2. Implement functions to generate a random array of integers and display the bars representing the array elements on the GUI.

3. Implement the three sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Bubble Sort.

4. For each sorting algorithm, modify the algorithm's code to include steps that update the GUI after each comparison and swap operation.

5. Create buttons or a dropdown menu in the GUI to allow users to choose the sorting algorithm they want to visualize.

6. Implement a speed control feature that adjusts the delay between each step of the sorting process.

7. Run the sorting algorithm step-by-step and update the GUI at each step to show the current state of the array.

8. Test the Sorting Visualizer with various input array sizes and observe how the algorithms work in different scenarios.

Optional Enhancements:

1. Add more sorting algorithms to the visualizer, such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

2. Include additional data structures like linked lists or trees and visualize how the algorithms sort these structures.

3. Allow users to input their custom array for sorting instead of generating a random array.

4. Add sound effects to make the visualization more engaging.

Remember to keep the code well-documented and add comments wherever necessary to explain the logic and steps taken in the sorting algorithms and visualization process. Happy coding!
